        INIT: First versions of enum and object mappers.

        v0.2:
        - Fixed: not using inherited properties;
        - Fixed: trying to initialize not settable properties.

        v0.3:
        - Fixed: not _setting_ inherited properties;
        - Fixed: trying to use not public properties (for now I'll just stick to just public ones).

        v1.0
        - Nothing really changed, I just updated configs. I think it's pretty ok-ish now. At least for me.

        v1.1
        - Finally made it work again, hopefully.
